# 2) Create run files
# a) extended blurred CS by 1 person
python train_city.py 1P_blurred

# b) extended blurred CS by half of the current persons
python train_city.py halfP_blurred

# 3) Run training on the new data

# 4) Finish evaluation of the networks with completed training.
# a) Run test_city.py with all of them.
# b) for each experiment EXP_NAME:
#   b1) convert the detections to json format with eval_city/dt_txt2json.py ${EXP_NAME}
#   b1) Evaluate them with eval_city/eval_script/eval_demo.py #{EXP_NAME}
# c) Plot the comparison of the results with eval_city/eval_script/plot_results.py

# 5) Evaluate all networks on Precarious Pedestrians
#    experiments: ['baseline', '1P', 'halfP', 'blurred']
